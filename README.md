# Miscellaneous Code

Here I've collected various side projects and code I wrote out of personal interest.

## Heap

I found the heap data structure interesting, particularly the concept of representing a binary tree as an array, and so I wrote an implementation of it from scratch to ensure I understood it. I also created a robust testing infrastructure and wrote several tests to ensure the implementation was correct.

## Binary Trees

Developed as solutions to problems found online, these algorithms showcase recursion on binary trees for the most part. I'm most proud of the algorithm to construct a tree from its preorder and inorder traversals alone!

## Linked Lists

This is my implementation of a doubly linked list.

## Tools

Here I include learning tools I made. `reading_practice.py` is made to help study Chinese characters and increase reading speed. It shows between 1 and 5 random characters (from the set defined in `characters.txt`) and cycles to new characters on any key press.
