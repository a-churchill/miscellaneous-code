# Miscellaneous Code

Here I've collected various side projects and code I wrote out of personal interest.

### Heap

I found the heap data structure interesting, particularly the concept of representing a binary tree as an array, and so I wrote an implementation of it to ensure I understood it. I also created a robust testing infrastructure and wrote several tests to ensure the implementation was correct.
