# Miscellaneous Code

Here I've collected various side projects and code I wrote out of personal interest.

### Heap

I found the heap data structure interesting, particularly the concept of representing a binary tree as an array, and so I wrote an implementation of it from scratch to ensure I understood it. I also created a robust testing infrastructure and wrote several tests to ensure the implementation was correct.

### Binary Trees

Developed as solutions to problems found online, these algorithms showcase recursion on binary trees for the most part; they are all efficient and all have low running times.
